# PROJECTS INFORMATION

## Project 1: CHECKLICK
### Organization Background
Our company Checklick is a web-based skills development platform based in Toronto, Ontario. Since 2013, we have been supporting sports organizations, building checklists and evaluating the performance of their athletes. Currently, Checklick operates in 18 countries and supports over 700 organizations, 128,000 users and has delivered nearly 750,000 evaluations. Our platform is used by Canadian and international governing sports organizations such as Sail Canada, to support youth training programs with specific skills athletes need to progress. Using the Checkclick system, a coach can perform skill evaluations and certify an athlete as well as generate a physical certificate for participants. 

### Description
Checklick is a Ruby on Rails 4.2 application, running Ruby 2.5.5.  We are using Postgres 9.6 as our database. The project will be divided into two sections that run parallel to one another: the first will be to implement a new frontend framework to our web application in order to make it more responsive and user friendly. We have decided to utilize Bulma as we consider it to be the most robust and easiest framework to learn as well as the most adaptive for implementation and contains the necessary components for our application. 
In addition, we would like to integrate a new library to our frontend with the objective of improving the readability of our code as well as improving the performance of the client-side application. Currently, our frontend is built on HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery. We want to integrate React as our new library as it is easy to learn and integrate into projects, in addition to being a library with a wide community of developers so it is easy to find documentation to resolve any issues we may encounter.

## Project 2: AGMEETING
### Organization Background
The National Campus and Community Radio Association/L'Association nationale des radios étudiantes et communautaires (“NCRA/ANREC”) is a not-for-profit national association working to recognize, support, and encourage volunteer-based, non-profit, public-access campus, community and native radio broadcasters in Canada. We provide advice and advocacy for individual campus and community (“c/c”) stations and conduct lobbying and policy development initiatives with a view to advancing the role and increasing the effectiveness of our sector. Our goals are to ensure stability and support for individual stations and to promote the long-term growth and effectiveness of the sector.

### Description
The AGMeeting platform transforms traditional Annual General Meetings. The technology provides seamless, end-to-end experiences for all your shareholders, whether they are in the room or are remote, or a mix of the two.  Using a smartphone, tablet or computer, AGM participants can follow Robers Rules, allowing for complete participation, including multiple methods of voting.  The system also works great for committee or other meetings where in-person and online meetings happen simultaneously.  The system is managed in real-time by a moderator.  This project is designed to complete a rebuild of the 2016 version, with updated code and new features (which was started in 2020). https://agmeetingwpclone.ncra.ca/about/


## Project 3: Cyclops
### Organization Background
Cyclops is an app that discusses the numerous industries and habits that directly contribute to the environmental crisis, especially through climate change and biodiversity loss. Cyclops is designed to inform anyone of these issues (regardless of pre-existing knowledge on the environmental crisis), equip them with reliable facts, and suggest solutions to the increasingly common question “Well how can I possibly help the environment?”. It gives overviews of each issue and how they impact the environment, and explores all that can be done at the individual scale, as well as what we should expect from businesses, communities, cities, and countries around the world. 

### Description
The students working on the capstone project would help transition the existing content (currently on a website) into an app for any type of device. Designing a simple, user-friendly, and visually-appealing app would be the end goal. The app will be mostly text based, however a few “app functions” will have to be incorporated in the design.


## Project 4: Traceable medical image de-identification pipeline for AI applications 
### Organization Background
The BC Cancer (BCC) is committed to reducing the incidence of cancer, reducing the mortality from cancer, and improving the quality of life of those living with cancer. It provides a comprehensive cancer control program for the people of British Columbia by working with community partners to deliver a range of cancer services, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, research, education, supportive care, rehabilitation and palliative care. BC Cancer is an agency of the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) which plans, manages and evaluates specialty and province-wide health care services across BC.

### Description
Applications of AI in medical research has the potential to greatly impact clinical practice, such as improving patient outcomes by creating more robust diagnoses. Currently, it is time consuming and difficult to acquire and curate large volumes of medical imaging data across various facilities while respecting and protecting personal health information (PHI).
 
Students will create a plugin to extend the open-source Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) server Orthanc (https://www.orthanc-server.com/) or create a general purpose PACS using a library such as Fellow Oak DICOM(https://github.com/fo-dicom/fo-dicom). The deliverables will be to extract and de-identify DICOM files, generate traceable patient crosswalk information, store the corresponding data, and remove any intermediate raw PHI. This system will then act as a Query/Retrieve service that can provide a set of studies by specified cohort to train AI.

## Project 5: Medical Image matching using AI for record linkage
### Organization Background
The BC Cancer (BCC) is committed to reducing the incidence of cancer, reducing the mortality from cancer, and improving the quality of life of those living with cancer. It provides a comprehensive cancer control program for the people of British Columbia by working with community partners to deliver a range of cancer services, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, research, education, supportive care, rehabilitation and palliative care. BC Cancer is an agency of the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) which plans, manages and evaluates specialty and province-wide health care services across BC.

### Description
Large amounts of patient information are generated every day at many different healthcare institutions throughout the province. While there are measures taken to ensure digital data integrity; in practice there are often discrepancies that arise from such things as manual data entry error, non-unique identification, and more.  This is problematic as curating datasets for medical research requires as much accurate information about a patient as possible, and missing or duplicate records may cause issues when training future AI projects and may create bias in the AI algorithms.
 
Students will work on curating an appropriate set of mammograms, which they will then use to test and train an image similarity model and/or develop an algorithm (For an example of an API with the idea, see https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/image-similarity). Implementation will be at the teams discretion and would potentially leverage open source machine learning technologies such as TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/) or  PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/). This model will then be used in conjunction with probabilistic matching for patient mismatch reconciliation.  Since this project involves working with human health data, students are expected to complete the Health Canada Course on Research Ethics -TCPS 2: CORE (https://www.tcps2core.ca/welcome).


## Project 6: Ethics Dashboard
### Organization Background
This application will be a teaching aid for courses in applied ethics at the College/University level. As a professor, the client is always looking for innovative and engaging ways to disseminate course content and evaluate student learning. 

### Description
The “Ethics Dashboard” will be employed by students to conduct case studies in ethics courses. The capstone project will be the first stage of a multistage project so it should be modularized such that the back end can be easily updated with future iterations. Also, a historical database should be created to securely store and collate all inputs from students and markers detached from individual identities. Some information about the project: (1) It should give support up to 120 students with private accounts that can allow them to work with up to five cases per term. (2) The user interface will need to offer text inputs on multiple pages that can be cross referenced. There are also simpler inputs such as check boxes that need to be totalled and sliders that should calculate averages. (3) Markers/professors will need be able to post in-text feedback and marks on a progress page. (4) Students should be able to download selected sections into report. (5) Markers/Professors should be able to download text reports for individual students and an Excel document with students’ marks for each class.

## Project 7: Woo Woo network
### Organization Background
The Woo Woo network is a new marketing platform that assists Healers to connect with Clients (kinda like AIRBNB). We support healers in connecting with clients, scheduling appointments, collecting payments, and depositing payments into the healer’s bank account. This service based platform allows the Healer to focus on their work without spending time on marketing their services.  This idea of connecting healers to clients was inspired by a real life problem. The client works with people who have gone through pregnancy losses and helps people to let go of grief. 

### Description
We are looking for innovative students who are eager to put their databasing skills to work. Also security will be a huge asset for this project to ensure everything is safe when handling payment services and other highly sensitive information.  Programming ability is a must. We are looking for people who would like to expand their abilities in testing and fixing bugs in programming and also in working with people as we will be beta testing with real users. There is also a huge opportunity to develop project management skills and to lead meetings to ensure everyone on their team is on track throughout the year.
 
The features we are eager to develop are: 1) mapping the healer locations to pair up with their ideal clients 2) search engines that include different mental health issues people may be facing 3) highlighting the scheduler for booked appointments and helping to make it compatible with Google calendars and Outlook calendars. The other areas that we would like to complete are: 5) working out bugs when put to the test, and 5) beta testing with real users.
