## How to Run GitStats on Your Repo

The details are given in the Installation section of the repo https://github.com/brandongk-ubco/gitstats. 
Here is a summary:

1. Use the online python environment called syzygy
2. Generate a personal access token in your GitHub account (this must be done by the person running the script to generate the report).
3. If this is your first time using it: Run the first three commands from the [example](https://github.com/brandongk-ubco/gitstats/blob/master/docs/examples/syzygy.ipynb). The commands are highlighted in grey cells, the output is shown below each command.
    - Note that the first command gets you to uninstall old versions and install the latest version of the script with a specific release version. (So if we have a newer release, you will need to uninstall the old one and change the version number to match the latest version.)
    - The second command verifies you are using the latest version.
    - In the third command, modify the access_token variable to be your personal one, modify the name of the repository variable to be your name and then the repo name, and lastly, modify the group_name variable so that it has the name of the project and the number (e.g., "LIMS 1"). When you run the command to generate the report, make sure you set the date to begin gathering the data from your repo from last Friday 8:00am (which is last week's deadline). Follow the example so you can be sure how to set the date and time.
    - The fourth command is pretty much the same as the second coomand, but it provides an additional example for the case where we are reporting on the data from last two weeks instead of last (one) week. This scenario might come up if we have reading week.
3. Once you have generated the report, save it in a .txt or a PDF file and submit it onto Canvas by the deadline.
4. If you want to use the Python code only, here are the plain Python examples (without the output shown): for one week and for two weeks



## FAQ

### What is the current release version of Gitstats?
The current version (as of Oct 08, 2020, 9pm) is v1.0.4. If you experienced an error with your report, please follow the new commands by uninstalling whatever you have, then re-installing. The latest version should show up correctly.
If you see your TA's username, you can now specify an input to filter out that name from the report.

### Will the TAs run the scripts?
Each team is responsible for submitting one report on Canvas. The TA will calculate the individual weekly mark accordingly. Each week, the TA will also randomly select 7 or more repos to run. If a mismatch is found between the report generated by the TA and the report that is submited, we will investigate more deeply to ensure that it is not an act of academic dishonesty. All cases of academic dishonesty will follow the standard university process.

### Why does my username show up in so many rows under the "Individual Contributions" section of the report?
This is because the script looks at the work done on each pull request (PR).

### Why are there only zeros in the comments column under the "Individual Contributions" section of the report?
This is because none of you made comments when reviewing another teammate's PR. It is helpful to comment on PRs and an easy way to contribute to the project.

### The report runs fine but the team score is 0. Why is that? 
This is probably because you haven't created any issues. Make sure you follow the instructions in the assignment (go to the assignment link, go to Git Basics, go to the bottom of the page to read about Issues).
Issues screen should look like this:

### I have created issues but the report indicates they are ignored. Why is that? 
This is probably because you are not labeling them properly. Make sure you follow the instructions in the assignment (go to the assignment link, go to Git Basics, go to the bottom of the page to read about Issues). It teaches you how to label issues properly. In particular, name them one of: chore, exploration, or task (don't be creative or they will get ignored). 

### The report generates fine but it shows no work is done. I am sure everything else is working correctly. Why is this happening? 
This is probably because you have an incorrect date range specified. The script looks for merge dates, not commit dates. So make sure you start and end at the right days and times.

### What should the start and end dates be for this week's report?
Most reports are for one week's worth of progress. To standardize all the update reports, use the start date as last Friday's date at 8:00 AM and the end date as this Friday's date at 8:00 AM. Second note: don't use a later end time, because that means if you start at 80:00AM next week, you will end up double counting some of the work.

### One or more of the repo contributors is not showing up. Why is that? 
This is probably because that missing user did not commit work to any of the PRs. What this means is, if you don't follow the git process properly by using PRs, even if you write code and commit it to the repo, it will not count. The commits need to be associated with a PR. Recall the purpose of this exercise was to introduce the git process to you. So use this opportunity to practice it.

Another reason might be that the missing user committed work but outside the specified time range. Remember that the script looks for merge dates, not commit dates. So make sure you start and end at the right days and times.

### The script generates an error. Why is that?
This is probably because one of your contributors used an email that does not match that of the Github account. We have released a fix for this and should work in v1.0.2 or higher. Please try again with the latest version of Gitstats.

### The individual efforts look unbalanced. Furthermore, understanding how the calculations work make it easy for a person to game the system to get a higher mark than s/he deserves. Is there a more fair way around this?
First, recall that your weekly contributions are calculated based on individual effort as well as team progress. If your team progress is deemed insufficient, the entire team can still get a low score. Second, when one member submits a PR, another team member is expected to review it. If the first member games the system and the second member approves the PR, it means that the two of them are both deliberating cheating and being dishonest about the work that is done. This behaviour is in direct violation of academic honesty and result in more severe punishment.

### I am still having problems. What should I do?
If you have checked everything you are doing is correct and the problem is not one of the above, then you can take a screenshot of the commands you used to run the program and include the associated report that is generated. Be sure your screenshots show your repo name and the output provided shows which version you are running. Once you have that, email me with a description of the problem along with the screenshots and I will get back to you.
