## Grading Peer Evaluations

To assess the quality of your peer evaluations, we want to look at how many you have completed and also how thoughtful and useful your comments are for others.

Your peer evals are marked out of 3, following the rubric below:

- **Score 0 = no submission**
- **Score 1 = some peer evals missing and comments are poor quality**: comments made are superficial or indicates nothing to report 
   
   _Examples_: 
    1. The student works harder than needed.
    2. The student is not supportive.
    3. The student is always complaining
    4. The student is very knowledgeable 
    
- **Score 2 = all evals completed and comments are mixed quality**
- **Score 3 = all evals completed and helpful comments made**: comments indicate attention to details, they offer constructive suggestions for improvement, show clear evidence of strengths observed in others, provide a balance of positive and negative feedback, comments are respectiful and devoid of inflammatory language
