# Useful information for the students


## Grievances and Complaints Procedures:
A student who has a complaint related to this course should follow the procedures summarized below:

- The student should attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor first. Students may talk first to someone other
than the instructor if they do not feel, for whatever reason, that they can directly approach the instructor.
- If the complaint is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student should go to the departmental head chair [Andrew Jirasek](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/andrew-jirasek/). Note that after January 2022, the departmental head chair is [John Braun](https://cmps.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/w-john-braun/))


## Academic Integrity: 
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating usually result in a failing grade or mark of zero on the assignment or in the course. Careful records are kept to monitor and prevent recidivism. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the policies and procedures, may be found [here](http://okanagan.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0)

If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.
