# Final Report 

## Project Deliverables (50%)

* (10%) A PDF report consisting of revised content of the previous submissions, including:
    * A brief description of the software you are building
    * A list of user groups for your software, along with an example scenario for each user group of how they will use the software
    * The DFD diagrams (level 0 and level 1, level 2 if appropriate) for the software -- fix all indicated mistakes from the previous submission
    * The functional requirements of the software that was built
    * A list of technical specifications that the software was built on and runs on
    
* (25%) An update on the status of the software implementation
    * Include an updated test report
    * If you have any requirement unimplemented, you will want to include an extra column or have an extra section showing those requirements have not been implemented
    * If you have a requirement that is partially working but feel that there's enough you don't want to call the whole requirement as incomplete, then break it up into two requirements, with one shown as tested and working, while the other is shown as not working
    * Indicate any known bugs in the software

* (10%) A step-by-step guide for handing over the project that includes:
    * Where the client can find your code
    * Any installation details needed
    * Any maintenance issues required by your client (e.g., account information, membership renewal dates and fees)
    * Any testing of existing features remaining that have not been done
    * Any features remaining that have not been implemented

* (5%) Links for the following:
    * A link to your github repo you used to build the project
    * A link to your promo video (see below)* 
    * A link to your presentation video (see below)* 

*since you are submitting the report before the promo video and the presentation video, you do not need to include the links in the final report. However, you should upload these links on Canvas before the final presentation (April 29th). The submission will be open on April 8th.

Note that each diagram must be explained clearly. Do not assume that the reader understands the intentions of your designs.

## Presentation expectations (50%)

The final exam has been scheduled on April 29th. Due to the size of our class, we will need to do the presentations in two paralell sessions. The slots for the presentations can be found here (). These slots have been randomly assigned.

Although there will be live presentations, you will need to record your presentation and submit it as a video. That way, I can watch **ALL** the presentations and we can avoid technical problems. These video recordings will be submitted one day after the exam (by April 28th, 7:00 pm). The guidelines for the presentation is as follows.
Note: Present your project to an audience who have never heard of it before. You can expect your audience to have some technical background (approximately second year undergraduate level) but not a lot. Introduce yourselves in the presentation. If we cannot see your face, at least include a picture. Dress appropriately if you are appearing on camera, and always speak in a professional manner.

Each group is expected to create a 10-12 minute presentation that includes a promo video and the following content:

* **A 2-minute promo video**: A clearly narrated and subtitled video showcasing specific features of your software - edit it properly and make it look professional. You can play this video at the beginning, middle, or end of your presentation. The time taken to play this video will be included as part of the 10 minutes
* A brief description of the software you are building: Don't repeat what you say in the video; if you feel like you've said it all in the video then just move onto the next point
* The target audience for your software and potential usage scenario: Elaborate on this if you haven't fully described it in the video
* The requirements, design, and test results of your software: Be selective in what you include here due to time limitations. Ensure what you say makes sense without additional context (your audience is new to your project)
* Identify at least one key distinguishing feature of your software so your client appreciates all the effort you've put into polishing it up
* Identify at least one technical challenge in your development process so your client understands the difficulty of the scope of the project
* Summary and future work:
    * Describe what needs to be done by the client once you pass the project onto them. 
    * If any work is left to be done, list those features. 
    * If they can pretty much take it and do a "plug-and-play" then tell them where the follow-up documentations and manuals are so they can follow those step-by-step.

### Requirements for the presentation:
* Rehearse your talk so it's smooth
* Everyone in the team needs to present (quantity can vary though)
* Eliminate typos and inconsitencies from slides
* Keep slides simple (not crowded with text)
* Use good visuals in the slides to help get your points across
* There's a lot of material listed above. If you find that you want to go into depth in more of the points than others, that's fine; you are not expected to go over everything in details within the time limit.

### You will be evaluated based on:

* (25%) Coherence, organization, and accuracy of content
* (5%) Clarity in presentation slides, use of diagrams, general aesthetics
* (5%) Preparedness, professionalism, timeliness, display of teamwork
* (5%) Clarity and pace in speech
* (10%) A 2-minute video for final product demo in .mov or .m4v format
