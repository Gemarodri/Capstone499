# Requirements and Design Milestone

The presentation slides and video link needs to be submitted on Canvas by the deadline. A PDF report needs to be submitted on Canvas by the deadline.

## How It Works

The first major milestone in this project is a synthesis of all the requirements that you have elicited from your client. 
Your job is to compile all this information and present it in a coherent fashion. 

There are several parts to the report that you will need to include:
- A high-level description (about one paragraph) of the software you are building and who the target user groups are. Separately, explain how each user group is expected to use the software differently. (Recall that in order for two users to be considered as being in two different user groups, they must use the system differently either via a functional or non-functional system requirement.)
- An overview of your system architecture presented as a data flow diagram (DFD), at both levels 0 and level 1, along with accompanying descriptions for each diagram. You must be very specific in this DFD so to design it in a way that supports an incremental and iterative development process. You can read an intro on DFDs and adopt its notation. Remember that a process does something, so be sure to use a verb to label your processes. In describing your DFD, highlight clearly which components will be delivered for each of the following milestones: peer testing #1, peer testing #2, and the final product. You may additionally wish to include extra components and label them as bonus features that may be developed if time allows.
- A detailed list of functional requirements for each milestone. Be sure to separate out the functional requirements for each system component based on the target milestone.
- A detailed list of non-functional requirements and environmental constraints for the overall project.
- Identify the tech stack you plan to use. If this is the tech stack required by your client, then state that in the document. If your client is flexible, you must indicate a clear rationale of the choice made. This means an extra page with a table of at least 3 options and document all pros and cons for each before letting your client make a choice.
- An explanation of how you will test the developed features of your system (in accordance with the tech stack chosen) as well as the method you will adopt to ensure continuous integration. Don't just use a technical term to describe the method; write a few sentences to explain the tools and techniques that will be involved. Read up on regression testing, and develop a feasiable plan that ensures when new code is added to your project that your project didn't break anything that was working before.
