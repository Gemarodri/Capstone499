## Peer Evaluations

For each milestone, you are asked to complete an evaluation for each of your team members based on the following criteria:

1. Contribution to group goals
    - **Score 5 (bonus)**: Actively takes a leadership role or supports the team leader; creates a positive example and makes others want to help out.
    - **Score 4 (very good)**: Consistently and actively works toward group goals; willingly accepts and fulfills individual role within the group
    - **Score 3 (good)**: Works toward group goals without occasional prompting; accepts and fulfills individual role within the group

2. Quality of individual contributions
    - **Score 5 (bonus)**: Always finishes individual work in advance and spends time to help others out to support them in finishing their work successfully.
