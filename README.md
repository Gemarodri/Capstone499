## Course outline 
**Course Participation:** The course will be held on campus. Due to covid restictions some exceptions would be available for some students to participate online. In order to engage fully with this course, students are required to have a laptop or desktop computer and a stable Internet connection.

For this course, the groups will have weekly meetings with their clients. This meetings can be online or offline, depending your client. For online meetings you will need a microphone, a web camera (recommended), and most importantly, a quiet space. You are also encouraged to turn your camera on for these meetings.


**Student Support:** Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the software required for their courses. There are a number of supports on campus to assist students with technical issues. For example, the [Student Learning Hub’s technical support](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/learning-hub/tech-support-for-online-learning/) is one such resource. There are also resources to support students in the online learning environment (e.g., [online learning coaches]( https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/learning-hub/online-learning-coaches/) , [time management skills](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/student-toolkits/managing-your-time/) , [preparing for exams](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/student-toolkits/preparing-for-exams/), and [online exams](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/online-exams/).


**Learning Outcomes:** Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Apply software engineering principles in a real world project
- Research the needs and interests of a particular target user group
- Determine key elements in complex issues, problems, and questions
- Collect, synthesize, and evaluate reliable information or data from relevant sources
- Manage, mitigate, and resolve conflicts
- Anticipate likely problems, consider unanticipated outcomes, propose the means by which resolutions may be
attained
- Gain a deeper understanding on key design and implementation issues
- Acquire experience on working with clients and professionals in industry

**Evaluation Criteria:** The evaluation criteria is detailed in this [document](EvaluationCriteria.md).

**Expectations:**
- Attend all classes and prepare before attending class.
