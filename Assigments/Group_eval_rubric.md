## Grading Group and Peer Evaluations

To assess the quality of the evaluations your team entered into the system, we want to look at how many the team have completed and also how thoughtful and useful the comments are for others. If a student has not participated in the group evaluation, the student will get a O. If all the students have participated, they will have the same grade.
Your group evals  are marked out of 3, following the rubric below:

- **Score 0 = no submission**
- **Score 1 = some evals missing and comments are poor quality**: comments made are superficial, or simply re-states obvious content, or indicates nothing to report 
   
   _Examples_: 
    1. Needs elaboration.
    2. Good job.
    3. You lost me.
    4. Did not do enough work.
    5. Worked too much.
    
- **Score 2 = all evals completed and comments are mixed quality**
- **Score 3 = all evals completed and helpful comments made**: comments indicate attention to details, they offer constructive suggestions for improvement, show clear evidence of strengths observed in others, provide a balance of positive and negative feedback, ask for specific clarifications where appropriate, comments are respectiful and devoid of inflammatory language
