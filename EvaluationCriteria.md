# EVALUATION CRITERIA, LATE POLICY AND PASSING CRITERIA

### Evaluation Criteria:
The evaluation is calculated based on three blocks: **Team marks (45%)**, **Individual marks (40%)**, and **Client Feedback (15%)**

For each individual block, the mark is calculated as follows:
### Team marks: 
- Requirements ----------------- (8%)
  
- Peer testing session #1 ------- (10%)
  
- Peer testing session #2 ------- (12%)
  
- Final submission ---------------(15%)

### Individual marks:
- Weekly contributions ---------------(35%)
  
- Completed student evaluations ------(5%)
  
### Client feedback:
- Evaluation 1: Midterm review -------(5%)
  
- Evaluation 2: Final review ----------(5%)
  
- Rankings --------------------------(5%)


### DESCRIPTION OF EACH BLOCK:

**Team marks:** The listed assignments are first given team marks assigned by the instructor based on the quality of the submitted deliverables and presentations. 
This team mark is then used in combination with peer evaluation reviews so that each individual will receive a mark calculated based on the group mark of the submission and the input made by their peers.

**Individual marks:** Each student is expected to contribute to the overall team deliverables weekly. Each team reports on their progress and individual contributions based on the work submitted. 
This information will be used to in combination with the individualâ€™s professionalism in class, as well as the overall team contributions and progress to create an individual mark.

**Client feedback component:** Project clients complete a questionnaire that provides input for a group mark assigned by the instructor. This is done twice throughout the project. 
The client will also be ranking the project teams based on submitted deliverables. That ranking will be used to produce a score for the teams. This will happen several times in the semester.

## Late Policy
All deliverables and presentations are due at the time stated. No late work without a valid medical note will be accepted. Presentations must be done on the scheduled date and time slot unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.


## Passing Criteria
In order to pass the course:
- Students MUST achieve a passing grade of >= 50% in the client feedback component.
- Students MUST achieve a passing grade of >= 50% in the team marks component.
- Students MUST achieve a passing grade of >= 50% in the individual marks component.

Failure to satisfy all of the above clauses will result in a maximum of 45% for the course.
