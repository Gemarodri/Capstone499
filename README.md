**Student Support:** Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the software required for their courses. There are a number of supports on campus to assist students with technical issues. For example, the [Student Learning Hub’s technical support](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/learning-hub/tech-support-for-online-learning/) is one such resource. There are also resources to support students in the online learning environment (e.g., [online learning coaches]( https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/learning-hub/online-learning-coaches/) , [time management skills](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/student-toolkits/managing-your-time/) , [preparing for exams](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/student-toolkits/preparing-for-exams/), and [online exams](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/online-exams/).


**Learning Outcomes:** Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Apply software engineering principles in a real world project
- Research the needs and interests of a particular target user group
- Determine key elements in complex issues, problems, and questions
- Collect, synthesize, and evaluate reliable information or data from relevant sources
- Manage, mitigate, and resolve conflicts
- Anticipate likely problems, consider unanticipated outcomes, propose the means by which resolutions may be
attained
- Gain a deeper understanding on key design and implementation issues
- Acquire experience on working with clients and professionals in industry

**Evaluation Criteria:** The evaluation criteria is detailed in this [document](https://github.com/Gemarodri/Capstone499/blob/main/EvaluationCriteria.md).
