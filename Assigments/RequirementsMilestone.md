# Requirements and Design Milestone

For the requirements milestone, students will neeed to do a presentattion and also a PDF report. The presentation slides need to be submitted on Canvas by the deadline. The PDF report needs to be submitted on Canvas by the deadline.

## How It Works

The first major milestone in this project is a synthesis of all the requirements that you have elicited from your client. You can do some of the learning activities related to the requirements that are available on CANVAS for elicting these requirements. Your job is to compile all this information and present it in a coherent fashion. 

There are several parts that you will need to include in the PDF report:
- A **high-level description (about one paragraph) of the software you are building and who the target user groups are**. Separately, explain how each user group is expected to use the software differently. (Recall that in order for two users to be considered as being in two different user groups, they must use the system differently either via a functional or non-functional system requirement.)
- **An overview of your system architecture presented as a data flow diagram (DFD), at both levels 0 and level 1**, along with accompanying descriptions for each diagram. You must be very specific in this DFD so to design it in a way that supports an incremental and iterative development process. You can read an intro on DFDs and adopt its notation. Remember that a process does something, so be sure to use a verb to label your processes. In describing your DFD, **highlight clearly which components will be delivered for each of the following milestones: peer testing #1, peer testing #2, and the final product**. You may additionally wish to include extra components and label them as bonus features that may be developed if time allows.
- **A detailed list of functional requirements for each milestone.** Be sure to separate out the functional requirements for each system component based on the target milestone.
- **A detailed list of non-functional requirements and environmental constraints** for the overall project.
- **Identify the tech stack you plan to use**. If this is the tech stack required by your client, then state that in the document. **If your client is flexible, you must indicate a clear rationale of the choice made**. This means an extra page with a table of at least 3 options and document all pros and cons for each before letting your client make a choice.
- **An explanation of how you will test the developed features of your system (in accordance with the tech stack chosen) as well as the method you will adopt to ensure continuous integration**. Don't just use a technical term to describe the method; write a few sentences to explain the tools and techniques that will be involved. Read up on regression testing, and develop a feasiable plan that ensures when new code is added to your project that your project didn't break anything that was working before.

According to our schedule, your presentation will be due a week before your report. The presentation is a way to give the teams early feedback so they can fix problems and include those fixes into the report (which is graded more heavily). The teams will receive the feedback from me and from the other teams. Thus, **the students must watch all of the requirements presentations**. That means, you will review 22 other presentations (since there are 23 teams in the class). With each presentation being approximately 8-10 minutes long, you will spend ~3.5 hours on reviewing the presentations + ~1 hour writing a "group evaluation". That leaves you with enough time to work on another tasks for your project in the rest of the week.

How does the "group evaluation" looks like?. This is a PDF where all the members of the team as a group will write their comments and questions anonymously. It is mandatory to write at least two questions for each presentation. The quality of your group evaluation (e.g., using helpful and constructive suggestions with specific references to the presentation, asking genuine clarification questions, identifying areas of strengths with specific references to the presentation) will be graded as part of your team weekly grade for this course (see rubric for details). For each group evaluation, please, write the members of the team that have contributed to the evaluation. Note that I expect **ALL members of the team to contribute to the group evaluation**, each student that does not contribute will lose points. Since the group evaluations are anonymous, I will remove the students' information before sending the group evaluations to each corresponding team.

Once the review period is over, each group wil need to read the evaluations from the other groups and compile them into their report. For questions asked, you will need to answer them to the best of your ability. If some questions are similar, you can combine them.

Also note that your report and presentation are graded separately. When the grader reads the report, don't assume the reader knows anything about the presentation. Likewise, if you have a mistake in the presentation, don't assume we will overlook it just because it might be correct in the report. We will not necessarily cross reference your work for you.


## Presentation Expectations

Each group gets 8-10 minutes to present a subset of the material from the report. All members of your team must present an equal amount of content. You will be evaluated based on:
- (5%) Professionalism, timeliness, display of teamwork
- (5%) Overall speech and high level descriptions
- (5%) Clarity in organization, use of diagrams, general aesthetics
- (5%) Content correctness and coverage


## Report Expectations 

Each group needs to submit a PDF report. There is no page limit. The report will be eavluated based on: 
- (10%) High-level project description with correct identification of user groups
- (10%) System architecture in DFD
- (10%) Breakdown of the target components for each milestone
- (20%) Functional requirements
- (10%) Non-functional requirements and environmental constraints
- (10%) Test strategy
- (10%) A list of questions raised by other students and your answers to them, giving us a sense of your ability to answer questions intelligibly
